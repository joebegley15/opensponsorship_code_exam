# opensponsorship_code_exam

Github repo for my application for Open Sponsorship's code exam.

The gitignore file here ignores the main node_modules file, so NPM install is still neccesary.

Server is housed in server.js.

Mongolab was used to house DB.


To start the application, clone the repo. Once you have it, migrate into the root directory. Run 'NPM install'. Once all packages are downloaded, run 'node server.js'.
